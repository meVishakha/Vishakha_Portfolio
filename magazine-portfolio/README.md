# Magazine Portfolio — Vishakha Yesaji

A typography-forward, magazine-style portfolio that presents projects as editorial spreads. Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

## How to use
- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click the file).
- Scroll horizontally or use the Prev/Next buttons to navigate spreads.
- Use the table of contents chips at the top to jump between sections.

## Customize
- Replace image paths in `index.html` (they currently point to `../images/...`).
- Update contact info in the `Contact` spread.
- Typography: adjust Google Fonts in `index.html` and their usage in `styles.css`.
- Colors: change CSS variables in `styles.css` under `:root`.

## Notes
- No build step required; it's pure HTML/CSS/JS.
- For best results, keep images large (≥1600px on the long side).
